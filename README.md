Hi I am Resa, I am writing about myself which is the most difficult part how to desrcibe myself. I dont know how to describe my self cause how you treat me is how I treat you. So if you treat me nicely I'm twice as nice as you. I think thats all, I am also consfused sometimes for myself. In this world I dont know what to do or what I do really want.
I give love, yes I do soo much that I almost forgot to love myself too. But the strange thing in this world is that nothing last forever, some people are just passing by some are worth on staying with some are teaching you whaT LIFE IS and some are just a waste of time. 
Some people are gonna betray you, stab you on your back which you feel a little bit painful cause you thought you can trust them but it turns out they are your most enemies. 
We got friends which we think they put colors in our life, our wife/husband who brings much meaningful and specially our children who brings joy and evertyhing in our life.
